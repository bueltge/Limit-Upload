# Limit Upload
Limit the number of uploads on posts

## Description
Limit the number of uploads from images/attachments on posts/pages and custom post types

## Installation
### Requirements
 * WordPress (also Multisite) version 3.3 and later (tested at 3.4)
 * PHP 5.3

### Installation
1. Unpack the download-package
1. Upload the file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Ready

### Usage
Current have the plugin no settings in the backend of WordPress - a problem of time from my site.

But you can simply change the values in the main file `limit-image-upload.php`. See in the method `start_limit_image_upload()` and change the values on the var `$args` for your requirements.
